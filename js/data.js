                    "As part of my computer security course, I worked with one other student to complete an end-to-end chat application. This project involved getting certified on SSL Labs, working with an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services, building an encryptor and decryptor using Python's Cryptography library, and using Node.js and Java for the server. While it is a rather small scale project, it provided me with exposure to the world of computer security.",
                    "Growing up around video games was the main reason I wanted to pursue a computer science degree. By my sophomore year, I challenged myself by making one on my one. Using my basic knowledge of Java and its Swing library, I created a 2-D desktop game based on one of my favorite games, League of Legends. The user controls a sprite of the character Ahri as she tries to charm other characters passing through the screen to become a frog. While it is a very basic game, it introduced me to just how much mathematical skill and bug testing is required for making video games. This project got me excited for what else I could create in the future."];

I volunteered to help Dr. Monge's JavaScript workshop where I assisted in introducing these young female learners to program in JavaScript. It involved the basic creation of variables and worked up to updating variables in order to animate objects on their screen. With computers being a part of every field imaginable nowadays, seeing how much the girls loved the class left me feeling hopeful about the future of the industry.",
